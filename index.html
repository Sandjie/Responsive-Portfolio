    <h1> About Me</h1>
    
    <img src="assets/images/me1.png" class="auth-image" alt="Sandra Swiatkiewicz">

   <p> My name is Sandra Swiatkiewicz. I was born in Warsaw, Poland and immigrated to 
     the United States when I was just 3 years old. I have lived in New York & New Jersey
     a majority of my life and just recently moved to Florida 2 years ago. I have been 
     in healthcare for the past 10 years and have decided on a major career change.
     I am excited to start a new journey. I love learning new and challenging things
     and I believe that it grows you as a person, both mentally and spiritually. It can 
     be a very humbling experience.</p>
   <P>I am looking forward to starting my career as a web developer. I strive
     to learn as much as possible on this new journey, to become the best
     that I can be in order to excel my employers and clients needs and expectations.
